\section{Introduction}

The Science Data Model (SDM) specification is a machine-readable specification for the physical data model for the publicly released science data products of the Rubin Observatory Project.
Meanwhile the \DPDD  represents an "idealized" data model that cannot directly be used as a recipe for the construction of a physical database schema and is not a full, precise definition of a data model.

It should be treated as a requirements document for the data model and schema rather than itself defining them. However we will not cover the evolution of the DPDD in this note.
